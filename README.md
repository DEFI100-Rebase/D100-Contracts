# DEFI100-Rebase

DEFI100-Rebase by Wrapp3d, Inc. is a decentralized algorithmic synthetic index token with elastic supply protocol. Inspired by AMPL & BASE protocol, DEFI100 is pegged to decentralized finance sector market cap at the ratio of 1:100 billion. It maintains a price peg by adjusting supply directly to and from wallet holders based on a data feed generated by decentralized oracles by our partner who are the leading on-chain oracle solution provider in the blockchain ecosystem. You can read more about DEFI100 on our [whitepaper](https://defi100.wrapped.com) 

Once live, DEFI100 will be the first synthetic asset that will be available in BEP-20 and first elastic supply protocol on Binance smart chain that is pegged to DEFI Market Cap. 

This repository is a collection of smart contracts that implement the DEFI100 on the Binance blockchain.
